~~Flappy~~ Floppy bird in CLI  

Note: due to limitations with the code author's intelligence, you won't be able to resize the terminal once you're in the game. Rip, bozo!

**Known Problems**  
- You can actually go under the pipes and not die (since you only die when you go 5 units below the bottom of the screen)  
- When you are on Mode 1 and die, if you are flying upwards you will fly upwards forever and the program will never exit. However, you can still Ctrl+C.
